# minesweeper-colors
Apply custom presets and themes to Google's Minesweeper.

This script allows you to customize the colos of the game and even apply presets or add presets of your own or others.

To use the script, you can first open up the console by pressing F12 or pressing the keys CTRL + Shift + I in order and clicking on the "Console" tab. Then, run the code from either `colors.js` or `colors.min.js`.
If you want to automatically run the script for whatever reason, you can save the scripts as a userscript for [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) or other userscript extenstions.

Enjoy.
